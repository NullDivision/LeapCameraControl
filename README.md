# LeapCameraControl

### Preface
This project was started as a contest entry in Techsylvania 2015 to use with Leap Motion controllers. To not let a half way decent project go to waste we decided to keep working on it.

The end.

### Description
This tool allows a user to control multiple input fields with simple but effective hand gestures using a Leap Motion controller.

### Dependencies
You will need `NPM` and `Grunt-cli` in order to build the project.

### Installation
Just run `npm install`. This will install any dependencies and compile files for use on your server.
